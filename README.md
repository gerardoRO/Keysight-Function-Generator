# Keysight-Function-Generator
Matlab Class to control Keysight's Function Generators using SCPI. In particular, this code has been tested in the 33500B function generator.

This Matlab Class was developed to control Keysight's 33500B series function generators using SCPI. It allows connection, communication, and work integration between Matlab and the function generator. 

Requires:

USB connection to the ocmputer
Measurement Toolbox from Matlab
vararginReader function , for parsing of inputs to methods.


This class was developed for research purposes. If used in any publications please cite accordingly.
